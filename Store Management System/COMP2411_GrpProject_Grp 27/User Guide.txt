***********  THIS APPLICATION WILL ONLY WORK ON THE POLYU CAMPUS NETWORK **************

- First, we need to import the "Shop Management System Application" folder into any IDE with Java support

- Run the "Start.java" class file in the start_application package

- The application should then work as expected




- For connecting to the Oracle server, I've used my own Oracle account's username and password

- If you want to connect to your own Oracle account, then first deploy the database in your own COMP Oracle account

- Then change the username and password in each of the Oracle server connections made in the following classes:

	Customer.java
	Employee.java
	Product.java
  	Supplier.java
	User.java

(All of these classes are in the "Attributes" package)
